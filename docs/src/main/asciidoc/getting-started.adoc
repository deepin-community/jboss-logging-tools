== Getting Started

To get started you need to include three dependencies in your project.

[frame=none,grid=none,options="noheader"]
|===
| link:{repourl}/jboss-logging/[JBoss Logging] | Required at compile time and runtime.
| link:{repourl}/jboss-logging-annotations/[JBoss Logging Annotations] | Required at compile time only.
| link:{repourl}/jboss-logging-processor/[JBoss Logging Processor] | Required at compile time only.
|===

If you're using maven here is an example `pom.xml` snippet:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependencies>
    <!-- Required by the annotation processor and will be used at runtime -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jboss.logging</groupId>
        <artifactId>jboss-logging</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jboss.logging</groupId>
        <artifactId>jboss-logging-annotations</artifactId>
        <version>{version}</version>
        <!-- This is a compile-time dependency of this project, but is not needed at compile or runtime by other
              projects that depend on this project.-->
        <scope>provided</scope>
        <optional>true</optional>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jboss.logging</groupId>
        <artifactId>jboss-logging-processor</artifactId>
        <version>{version}</version>
        <!-- This is a compile-time dependency of this project, but is not needed at compile or runtime by other
              projects that depend on this project.-->
        <scope>provided</scope>
        <optional>true</optional>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

Once your project is configured you can create either a <<Message Bundle Interfaces,message bundle interface>> or a <<Message Logger Interfaces,message logger interface>>. For detailed information see the link:{javadocsdir}/index.html[JavaDocs] for the annotations.
